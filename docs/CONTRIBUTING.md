# Contributing
Firstly, thank you for wanting to contribute to the Event API!
To assure your update gets merged as soon as possible, please take a brief second to read these guidelines.

Before posting a pull request, please make sure your code:

- does compile. We obviously can't accept any pull requests with blatant syntax errors :frowning:

- is well documented. Although documenting your code can be annoying, it really helps others understand your code more easily.
  While you don't need to excessively document every single piece of code, please make sure that atleast all classes and
  public (if possible also protected) methods are documented. Please also add an `@author` tag with your name to all classes
  you have been working an and add a proper `@since` tag to new classes/methods. **TL;DR:** Document your code within reason.
  
- is useful. "Fix whitespace" is not needed. However feel free to fix typos, if you spot any.
